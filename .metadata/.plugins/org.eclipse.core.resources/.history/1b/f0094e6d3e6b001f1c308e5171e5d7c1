/*
 * In this project we are going to start using Spring Data JPA 
 * 	>> Spring Data JPA behind the scenes uses Hibernate which is a ORM framework build on top of JDBC
 * 
 * 		Problems we came accross in 
 * 			 In JDBC we have to query SQL code by ourserlves
 * 		     If we have to one DAO class for every single table which we will comeacross in the project
 * 			 We are writing multiple CURD operations again and again to perform DB actions
 * 
 * 	>> To overcome this we have 3 important interfaces
 * 		1) CurdRepository
 * 		2) JpaRepository
 * 		3) Paging AndSortingRepository
 * 
 *  ?? In application properties we are gogin to specify the Database configurations
