/*
 * IN THS PROJECT WE ARE GOING TO USE SPRING + JDBC API
 * 		We use connection pooling mechanism where we maintain pool of predefined connection objects and when we want to connect to DB we use existing connection
 * 		 objects and we need not close those connections.
 * One of the most commonly used connection pooling mechanism is Hikari Connection Pooling mechanism
 * 
 * In Spring boot hikari cp will come by default, we need not download those JAR's 
 * 		
 * Let's specify all the details rearding Data base in application properties
 * 			.. check how we specified url... since it is local host we can skip host and port url by 3 slashes
 * 
 * We have dao layer
 * 		1) Details pojo class
 * 		2) Interface of what we implement in dao layer
 * 		3) Getting details from DB using that interface
