 * Spring Boot:
	
	Advantages of SpringBoot
		Simplying the build(either Maven/Gradle) using starter pom

		Autoconfiguration:
			-> Component scanning
			-> Intializing IOC Container
			-> Creating connection pooling(Default is Hikari Connection Pool)
			-> We have default embeded server which is tomcat server
			-> We have actuators to know the status of the application to know how many beans are loaded


	Ways to develop spring boot application
		1) Using spring initializer--> start.spring.io
		2) Using STS


	SpringApplication.run() contains logic to start Spring IOC container

	Different classes will be used based on the application(what we specify as dependency ex: boot-stater, boot-starter-web. boot-starter-webflux etc) to genrate an ApplicationContext container

	@SpringBootApplication annotation is equivalent to: component scan + enable auto configuration + configuration
		(right click + open declaration)
		
	All the classes under this primary package will be considered while doing component scanning so for any new package where we want to do component scanning
		it has to be under this hierarchy.
		
	To remove spring banner, we can go to resources-> application.properties
		When we specify anything in application.properties, automatically all the configurations will be loaded by spring
		We can define DB connection, port at which the application is deployed etc..
		The data should be given the form of key- value pair
		# Check the file, we specified spring.main.banner-mode =off and no spring banner is created
		We can create our own banner by creating a text file in resources with that name and loading it using spring.main.banner-mode = banner.txt(zetcode is website to generate text)
